# JamJar Relay Server

This is a 'relay server', designed to allow self-hosted games to be run with the server acting as an intermediary
between all of the clients. This allows for a generic networking solution that allows games to be hosted by a client
and all messages are forwarded, or 'relayed' to other clients through the server.
